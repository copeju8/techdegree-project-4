Submission - Project 4: OOP Game Show App 7/15/19
Goal: "Exceeds Expectations"
- App styles have been personalized ( adapted graphics (pictures) for start and end events)
- Add event listener for keydown event so that pressing a physical keyboard button results in
the handleInteraction() method being called for the associated onscreen keyboard button.
