# OOP GAME SHOW APP 

This game show app is a browser-based, word guessing game: "Phrase Hunter" using JavaScript and OOP (Object-Oriented Programming) to select a random, hidden phrase. A player tries to guess the phrase by selecting individual letters from an onscreen keyboard. Can they guess the phrase before they run out of attempts?
